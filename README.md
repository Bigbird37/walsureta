# TrashBot
(might rename this lol)

A replay bot for Geometry Dash

## TODO
- clean and split up code
- 2 player support
- [no hardcoded fps](https://github.com/matcool/TrashBot/blob/master/Replay.cpp#L35)
- saving to a file
- (?) fix the practice mode inconsistencies (holding while in the death animation won't get added to actions in the next attempt)
- (?) make it consistent
- unload DLL button (would help development a lot)
